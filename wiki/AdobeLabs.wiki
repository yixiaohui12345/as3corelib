#summary Information on obtaining the old library code from the Adobe Labs SVN
#labels labs

= Introduction =

The original code for this project was hosted on the Adobe Labs SVN server.  It is still available should you need it.

= Details =

 * To view the repository in a web browser, navigate to: http://labs.adobe.com/svn/flashplatform/?/projects/corelib/ 

 * To checkout the code, use "svn checkout http://labs.adobe.com/subversion/flashplatform/projects/corelib"

 * If you insist on using the source code browser, when you find a class that you want, click on the "text" link rather than the class name to get a text version. The text version preserves the original formatting and doesn't add line numbers.
